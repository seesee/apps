# CC's Apps
A central repository linking to some of my public apps.

## Web Apps
All my webapps are self-contained and run in-browser using local storage. 
No tracking or other nonsense is included. Everything is 100% private and 
can work completely offline (just save as file, or host it yourself).

### Activity Tracker
[Activity Tracker](https://seesee.github.io/apps/activity-tracker/) 
is a (mostly) single page web app that allows you to track what you're doing 
throughout the day.

### Templatimator
[Templatimator](https://seesee.github.io/apps/templatimator/)
is a quick way of taking a text outline, applying a bunch of variables to it
and outputting as text/html/csv etc.
